    question: 'How are recordings and test cases related to each other?',
    answer: (
      <div>
        <p>
          Replay records content processes. For browsers, that’s tabs. For Node, that’s processes.
          Cypress runs each spec in its own tab, so a Replay recording will include all of the test
          cases in the spec. Playwright will often open a new page per test case, so it is typical
          for recordings to map 1-to-1 to test cases. However, it’s possible for a single Playwright
          test case to open multiple pages at which point one test case might have multiple
          recordings.

  {
    question: 'What is the difference between uploading and processing a recording?',
    answer: (
      <div>
        <p>
          Replay gets its name because recordings are replayed in their original runtime after the
          fact. In order to be able to start debugging a recording quickly, we need to be able to
          process it beforehand. That means replaying it once and gather assets that’ll help us
          start the replay efficiently the next time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because it takes approximately as long to replay a recording as to record it in the first
          place, we try to be selective about which recordings are processed. We also count
          recording processings in increments of 3 minutes as a way to normalize costs across teams.
          The typical recording is 52 seconds, so this should not come into play, but we don’t want
          the typical team to “pay” for the processing costs of teams with exceptionally long
          recordings.

  {
    question: "What happens if I exceed my plan's included test case runs?",

        <p>New recordings will not be uploaded.</p>

    )
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I run Replay alongside Cypress Dashboard?',
    answer: (
      <div>
        <p>
          Absolutely. Replay is a Cypress plugin and can be used with other plugins and the Cypress
          Cloud. In fact we encourage you to. We think that it is helpful to use Replay for
          debugging and a dashboard provider for suite-level insights and orchestration.

    question: 'What is Replay.io’s approach to privacy?',
    answer: (
      <div>
        <p>
          Recordings are private by default. You own your own recordings. We will not sell or use
          your recording data in any way. Moreover we do not have access to view the recordings
          unless they are shared with us.
        </p>

    )

  {
    question: 'What is Replay.io’s approach to security?',
    answer: (
      <div>
        <p>
          Replay.io uses standard end-to-end encryption and networking security practices and has
          achieved SOC2 Type II. Replay.io is also architected with both a safe-by-design and
          minimal-blast-radius approach. See our
          <Link href="https://docs.replay.io/resources-and-examples/security-practices">
            security practices
          </Link>{' '}
          and <Link href="/security-and-privacy">policies</Link>
          for more information and don’t hesitate to reach out to security@replay.io if you have
          additional questions.

  {
    question: 'Do I need a credit card to sign up?',
    answer: (
      <div>
        <p>
          No - when you create a team you are starting a free trial for 30 days. You’ll only need to
          add a credit card if you’d like to continue using the team beyond the 30 day limit.
        </p>

    )
  },
  {
    question: 'How will you charge me?',
    answer: (
      <div>
        <p>
          We ask for a credit card. Your credit card information will never touch our servers as we
          use <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> our payments processor. For Enterprise
          customers we can do ACH and custom invoices if requested.

    question: 'Can I cancel at anytime?',
    answer: (
      <div>
        <p>
          Definitely! You can cancel or downgrade your subscription at anytime. You can also delete
          your workplace in the settings page at anytime.
