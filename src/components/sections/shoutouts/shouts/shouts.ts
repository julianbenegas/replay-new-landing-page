I believe it won't be an exaggeration to say that it has the potential of replacing the traditional "bug reports". Recording the video, making screenshots, carefully describing reproduction steps, dropping a ".har" file, all of that won't not necessary if you use Replay. It does it all for you, and more. Attaching a Replay to the bug report allows the person debugging to jump to any point in time of the bug occurrence and understand what has happened, which is the real essence of debugging. No more "it works on my machine"! 😅`

Really doing browser state right vs a hack that gets you halfway there (I'm fond of these, who doesn't love Redux time travel) really pays off in Replay. It feels so good to be able to trust the tool to produce a solid recording of behavior you don't yet understand. Replay is made possible by truly great tech that the team has pioneered.
